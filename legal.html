            <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br><br><strong>Liability for Content</strong><br><br>
                The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot assume any liability
                for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible
                for our own content on these pages according to § 7 para.1 DDG under general laws. According to §§ 8 to
                10 DDG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
                information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or
                block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected by this. Any liability in this regard
                is, however, only possible from the time we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming
                aware of such violations, we will promptly remove the content in question.<br><br><strong>Liability for
                    Links</strong><br><br>
                Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, over whose content we have no control.
                Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
                operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages were checked for
                possible legal violations at the time of linking. No unlawful content was recognizable at the time of
                linking. However, permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific
                indications of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will promptly remove such
                links.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
                The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
                The duplication, editing, distribution, and any kind of utilization beyond the limits of copyright law
                require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are
                permitted for private, non-commercial use only. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by
                the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is
                marked as such. If you nonetheless become aware of a copyright violation, please notify us accordingly.
                Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will promptly remove such
                content.<br><br><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br><br>
                The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data
                (for example, name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done, where
                possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit
                consent. <br>
                We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication via email) may
                have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
                possible. <br>
                The use of contact data published in the context of the Legal Info (Impressum) obligation by third
                parties for the
                purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and informational materials is expressly objected to. The
                operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited
                sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
